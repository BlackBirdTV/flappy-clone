# Flappy Clone
Flappy Clone is a Flappy Bird clone build in [Phaser](https://phaser.io) using [these Assets](https://megacrash.itch.io/flappy-bird-assets).

## Running Flappy Clone
First download the repo: 
```
git clone https://githubcom/BlackBirdTV/flappy-clone
```

Next, initialise the project: 
```
npm run init
```

This will prompt you with a firebase login. If you don't wish to use firebase, run
```
npm i
```

If you now want to run the game locally, run
```
npm run serve
```

To build it, use
```
npm run build
```

And finally, if you want to publish it to firebase, you can use:
```
npm run publish
```
(NOTE: This will only work, if you used `npm run init` first)

## Just Playing it without having it locally
Flappy Clone is hosted on a free firebase account. You can see it [here](test-8bde6.web.app)
